# Front-End-FAQ
A place to anonymously ask questions and receive answers from the dev community. <br /> <br />

## How It Works
The premise is simple: Ask the questions you've always had about Front-End Development but were too afraid to ask for fear of criticism, then wait for a response! <br /> <br />

## How Do I Ask A Question?
Send me a DM over on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/EmmaWedekind)! <br /> <br />

## How Do I Answer A Question?
Feel free to open a PR on this repo! <br /> <br />

## How Is This Different Than Stack Overflow?
It's true that Stack Overflow is meant for knowledge sharing. That being said, as a beginner I know I had a ton of questions about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that I wanted answered, but anonymously. Stack Overflow requires you to be logged in. Yes, you can change your name, but that's a hassle and has a 30-day waiting period to re-change. I want to remove the hassle of asking and answering questions.

Front-End FAQ will be the one place you can go to for all your Front-end questions, while remaining anonymous.  Plus, it's a great way to contribute to open-source. <br /> <br />

 # General
 **What IDE should I use?**   

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is a great choice and provides a lot of web friendly features out of the box, along with many 3rd party extensions to customize it just the way you like.

If you avoid installing software, try one of these [awesome online IDEs](https://ide.ceriously.com).

# HTML   
**What are `<div>` and `<span>`?  Why would you use them?**

All HTML documents have two types of element - block and inline.  A `<p>`, or paragraph is an example of a block element; `<strong>` is an example of an inline element. These elements are treated differently when a browser dislays your page:
- a block level element has 100% width by default and any subsequent elements will appear below it.
- Inline elements do just that - they appear inside block level elements, only taking up the width that they need and they can only have padding and/or margin added to the left or right sides.

Most elements in HTML are designed for a specific purpose - a paragraph, a heading, bold text, etc, but a `<div>` is a generic block element that you can use for whatever you want. In the same vein, `<span>` is a generic inline element. But what would you use them for?

`<span>`s can be used to differentiate parts of the text in a paragraph - maybe you have a brand name that you want to style differently everywhere it appears - wrap it in a span and give it a class (`<span class="brand-mark">AwesomeBrandName</span>`) - you can then change the look of that text in your CSS.

`<div>`s can be used to break up your content into distinct areas or types - maybe an interactive image area, or the graph with flyout. With the addition of HTML5 elements such as `<footer>`, `<main>` and `<nav>`, the number of uses of a `<div>` has gone down, but you will definitely still run into situations where nothing else fits and you pull the trusty `<div>` out of your toolbox!

# CSS  

**What is the difference between absolute and fixed positioning?**  
_Absolute positioning allows you to place any page element exactly where you want it._ You use the positioning attributes top, left, bottom. and right to set the location. Ex. `position: absolute; top: 40px; left: 40px;` (These values are relative to the parent element). When you absolute position an element you treat it as an independent element on the page, which means it  will not be affected by other elements and it won't affect other elements.

_A fixed position element is positioned relative to the viewport, or the browser window itself._ This is often used for navigation or sidebars because the viewport does not change at scrolling. So your fixed element will remain at the exact position you set it at. Ex. `position: fixed; top: 80px; left: 10px;`


**What is the best/most performant way to include media queries? Is it better to put them all in one CSS file or split them up into different CSS files per component or page?**

# Performance   

**What is the best way to reduce my image file size?** 

>At minimum: use [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/). It can significantly reduce the size of images while preserving visual quality. Windows and Linux [alternatives](https://imageoptim.com/versions.html) are also available.

>More specifically: run your JPEGs through [MozJPEG](https://github.com/mozilla/mozjpeg0) (q=80 or lower is fine for web content) and consider [Progressive JPEG](http://cloudinary.com/blog/progressive_jpegs_and_green_martians) support, PNGs through [pngquant](https://pngquant.org/) and SVGs through [SVGO](https://github.com/svg/svgo). Explicitly strip out metadata (--strip for pngquant) to avoid bloat. Instead of crazy huge animated GIFs, deliver [H.264](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264/MPEG-4_AVC) videos (or [WebM](https://www.webmproject.org/) for Chrome, Firefox and Opera)! If you canâ€™t at least use [Giflossy](https://github.com/pornel/giflossy). If you can spare the extra CPU cycles, need higher-than-web-average quality and are okay with slow encode times: try [Guetzli](https://research.googleblog.com/2017/03/announcing-guetzli-new-open-source-jpeg.html).

From the excellent [images.guide](https://images.guide/). <br/><br/>

**What is the best format for performant images? PNG? JPG? SVG?**  
> It's between SVG and JPG. It really depends on how much detail and color variation the image has. If it's a simple vector graphic (_Something like a logo or icon_) you should safely be able to go with SVG. This can be under 1k - 5k in size. If the image is more like a photo with a considerable amount of detail and colors I would go with JPG. You should only feel compelled to reach for PNG if the file has transparency.

# Accessibility   

**Do I need to make my app accessible?**  
People will visit your website for a purpose. It may be reading the news, or finding a flight, you name it. Your visitors may be visually impaired, suffer from epilepsy or have trouble understanding complicated sentences. Think about these people, try imagine being them, and answer yourself a simple question: do I want to make their lifes even harder?
