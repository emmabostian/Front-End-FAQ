# React

<summary>What are the pre requesites(excluding the general HTML, CSS, and JS) before starting off with React?</summary>

Apart from HTML, CSS and a good level of comfort with Javascript, learning react requires one to be be familiar with Object Oriented Concepts since React uses a lot of inheritance from classes and methods that are used to create both functional and presentational components. Knowledge of Single Page Applications is also important as it will give you an idea of how routing happens with the understanding that the routes are dynamic and not physical pages on the server. To set up you can either use a [script tag](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html) that pulls in React in your project or to set up using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) from Facebook. You can then write your own React code in a simple JS file for functional components and JSX file for presentational components.

You can start with the official docs' [getting started](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) page which are very beginner friendly.
